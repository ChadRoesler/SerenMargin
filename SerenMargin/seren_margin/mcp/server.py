"""
seren_margin.mcp.server
═══════════════════════

Wires the FastMCP server INTO the existing FastAPI app at /mcp.

Same process, same port. The MCP tools call MarginStore directly - no HTTP
round-trip back to ourselves. One install, one approval surface, one set of
logs. Mounted at /mcp by default; override via SEREN_MARGIN_MCP_MOUNT.

This is a near-exact sibling of seren_memory.mcp.server and seren_loci.mcp.server
- the same three transport footguns bite any FastMCP-into-FastAPI mount, so the
same three fixes apply. Kept parallel on purpose: fix one, fix all three.

SDK COMPATIBILITY: the modern transport is streamable HTTP
(`streamable_http_app()`); older versions used SSE (`sse_app()`). We try the
newer first and fall back, so this works across a range of installed versions.

A NOTE ON THE BIND ADDRESS, because it matters more here than in the siblings:
mounting MCP does NOT widen the listener. SerenMargin still defaults to
127.0.0.1 while Memory defaults to 0.0.0.0 - these are private notes and they
don't go on the network just because the transport now could. If you widen the
host on purpose, put auth in front of it on purpose too.
